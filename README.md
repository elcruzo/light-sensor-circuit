# Light Sensor Circuit - Software Implementation

A microcontroller-based light sensor data logging system optimized for low-power operation and stable performance under variable light conditions.

## Project Overview

This project implements the software components for a light sensor circuit designed in LTSpice and implemented on PCB using KiCAD. The system is optimized for energy-efficient devices with real-time data collection and analysis capabilities.

## Features

- **Low-Power Operation**: Optimized for minimal power consumption
- **Real-Time Data Logging**: Continuous sensor data collection with buffering
- **Noise Reduction**: Advanced signal processing for stable readings
- **Configurable Sampling**: Adjustable sampling rates and thresholds
- **Data Analysis**: Built-in statistical analysis and trend detection
- **Power Management**: Sleep modes and wake-up optimization

## Hardware Requirements

- Microcontroller (Arduino/ESP32/STM32 compatible)
- Light sensor (photodiode/phototransistor)
- ADC interface
- Optional: SD card for data storage
- Optional: Real-time clock (RTC)
