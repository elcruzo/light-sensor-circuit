## Design Overview

The light sensor circuit is designed for:

- **Low Power Operation**: Optimized for minimal power consumption
- **Stable Performance**: Noise reduction and signal conditioning
- **Microcontroller Integration**: Easy interface with various MCUs
- **Energy Efficiency**: Suitable for battery-powered devices

## Key Components

- **Light Sensor**: Photodiode or phototransistor
- **Signal Conditioning**: Op-amp based amplifier
- **Power Management**: Low-dropout regulator
- **Microcontroller Interface**: ADC input with proper buffering

## Files to Add

When you have the hardware design files ready, please add them to the appropriate subdirectories:

1. **KiCAD Files**: Place schematic and PCB files in `schematics/` and `pcbs/`
2. **LTSpice Simulations**: Place simulation files in `simulations/`
3. **Manufacturing Files**: Place Gerber files in `gerbers/`
4. **Documentation**: Add design notes and specifications in `documentation/`

## Integration Notes

The software is designed to work with the hardware through:
- ADC pin configuration
- Reference voltage settings
- Calibration parameters
- Power management features

Refer to the software configuration files for hardware-specific settings.
